# Estimation of Inbreeding Coefficient Using Monte Carlo Methods

The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium plays a key role in methods of human genetics. It describes that the allele frequencies and the geno-type frequencies are constant across generations, and there should be a simple relation between these two types of frequencies in a large random-mating population given that there exist no selection, mutation, and migration. When the selection assumption is violated, the inbreeding model is used to test the departure from the HW equilibrium. There have been multiple methods of estimating the inbreeding coefficient, but none of them demonstrated a state-of-the-art performance due to the difficulties of solving complex integrals. Therefore, in this paper we propose an improvement to the current inbreeding coefficient estimation methods by introducing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo as an integration approximator. The experiment result shows that the Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs was the best performer among all the MCMC approaches for both high-dimensional and low-dimensional data.
